## Iceland Volcano 

> The Iceland Volcano is a photograph taken in Sept' 2021 in Fagradalsfjall, Iceland.
> The volcano was already erupting since March 2021 and overall was erupting for six months.
> Therefore, these were the last breaths of the lava from the Fagradalsfjall. 
> The roughness, but also the softness since the lava was not that active anymore, is displayed in this beer
> with a mild taste of smoke, which is the only thing left.
