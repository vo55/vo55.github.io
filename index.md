> The Iceland Volcano is a photograph taken in Sept' 2021 in Fagradalsfjall, Iceland.
> The volcano was already erupting since March 2021 and was active for six months.
> Therefore, these were the last breaths of the lava from the Fagradalsfjall. 
> The roughness, but also the softness since the lava was not that active anymore, is displayed in this beer
> with a mild taste of smoke, which is the only thing left.

> The small lighthouse in Drochtersen at Krautsand Beach. 
> Whilst lighthouses can experience stormy and rough days, this time it showed it's other side:
> A beatiful day with the warmth of a colorful sunset. Also it keeps in mind, that this is not 
> a typical and big lighthouse, layed directly at the sea. This lighthouse is laying
> at the Elbe river, and whilst it knows big containerships, it can't imagine the drama some of 
> the bigger lighthouses have seen.
> The taste of this beer intends to have a bitter and nordish character, but also with the innocent sweetness that this lighthouse possesses.
